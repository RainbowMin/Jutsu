Unity3D POC : Jutsu based skill game
*Warning: the size of this repository is almost 1go - download with caution*

This project is to teach myself how to use Unity3D and its environment : animation with Blender, sounds customization with Audacity etc.

Demo on youtube : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Y27xpywi0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Y27xpywi0)

The end sequence "THANKS FOR WATCHING" has been been made with a SVG to Points application that can be found here : https://github.com/Shinao/PathToPoints

A PathFollower class will gradually move to pass every points of the SVG which will result in it being drawn.<br>
The PathMeshRenderer class has been created to make some kind of branch jutsu feature.<br>
A custom particle renderer or the like could be created to make any other cool animation.<br>

### What I have learnt
- Blender UI is horrible - do not use it unless you have too (life or death situation)
- Do not use Unity3D beta version - Crashes time and time again
- Do not reinvente the wheel even for the small things
- There is a Unity3D discord channel which is active and people there are great : https://discordapp.com/channels/85338836384628736/85593628650504192

### Note
Probably some minor credits are missing, if you catch something that should be in there, contact me.<br>
Note that to lighten the size of this repository, I have stripped down the assets a bit (textures not used etc.), you probably want to download it again if you want to use it.
